# D&D Characters

This project is a web application built on Node.js and several other frameworks and libraries that allows users to create, edit, browse, and organize characters for the popular Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game. In its current state, users can register using a local account, Facebook, Google Plus, or Twitter. Once logged in, they can create, edit, and delete characters.

Still young, the project will only support 5th edition and currently only allows for character names. I am currently working on building out the database schema and views for the application. I will continue working towards building an intuitive and streamlined platform for storing and organizing character details.

## Installation

Installation is a little tricky right now because I'm hiding a lot of my configuration for Passport and my database. I'll update installation as I progress towards launch.

# D&D Characters

This project is a web application built on Node.js and several other frameworks and libraries that allows users to create, edit, browse, and organize characters for the popular Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game. In its current state, users can register using a local account, Facebook, Google Plus, or Twitter. Once logged in, they can create, edit, and delete characters.

Still young, the project will only support 5th edition and currently only allows for character names. I am currently working on building out the database schema and views for the application. I will continue working towards building an intuitive and streamlined platform for storing and organizing character details.

## Installation

You'll want to make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

Run `npm install` and wait a couple minutes for everything to install.

You'll have to populate an env.json file in the env folder with several pieces of information. I've included an example of this file. You'll want to fill in this example with all the appropriate information. Once you have this set up, you can run `npm start` to launch the application in the development environment.
